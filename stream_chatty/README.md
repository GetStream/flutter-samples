# Stream Chatty

Stream Chatty is a sample chat app made in Flutter using [Stream Chat](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/flutter/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and [flutter_bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/). It has full light and dark mode support, real-time chat, and full authentication using Firebase auth.
